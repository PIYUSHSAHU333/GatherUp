          This platform is built to simplify the way students discover and share
          college events. From tech fests and workshops to hackathons and
          seminars, we bring them all into one place â€” searchable, filterable,
          and easy to access. Whether you're looking to attend or promote an
          event, our goal is to help students stay informed and involved across
          campuses in India.
